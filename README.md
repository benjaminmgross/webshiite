#README.md

As a super dooper newbie to web development, css, & javascript I thought that doing my own website would help me begin to understand the ins and out of this chicanery.

Simple steps I took to get the site up and running:

1. Went and set up a **free** (as in beer) account at [000webhost](http://www.000webhost.com/).
2. Went to [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) and changed the `nameservers` to those provided by `000webhost`
3. Took a sample bootstrap file under `boostrap>examples>`, changed the header size, messed with some `css`
4. Took the files under `bootsrap > dist ` and added those to my `home` directory for my website.
5. Looked up `ftp`-ing and then set up an ftp connection with computer and `000webhost` and then `ftp`-ed the file structure on my computer to the `000webhost` account
